* File-level backups with tar and bz2.
* SCP Transfer of created backups to pre-configured server

* Script documentation and generalization to support extensibility and modification

## Why the stupid name?
_zipBraT2_ is an anagram of Tar Bzip2, the compression method used for the file backups.

## This is pretty amateur...
That may be true, however, I am still learning and adding modifications all the time.

Since I actually use this every day I am always finding things to improve and add.

It isn't that impressive but it has taught me a lot, even if I mostly do OOP.
